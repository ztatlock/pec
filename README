Bouncer : only let in the good optimizations.

INTRO

  This software implements the checking algorithm from 'Proving
  Optimizations Correct using Parameterized Program Equivalence' by Kundu,
  Tatlock, and Lerner in PLDI 2009. Bouncer attempts to automatically prove
  that a given optimization always preserves program behavior.

BUILDING

  Bouncer depends on the OCaml language and supporting tools.
